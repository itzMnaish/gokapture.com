                Mahalaxmi Race Course on November 4 and 5, 2023, was a resplendent success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having cemented its reputation as India’s leading online beauty shopping platform, <a
                    href="https://www.nykaa.com/">Nykaa</a>Nykaa has expanded rapidly since its inception in 2012,
                celebrating women and empowering them with its immensity of choices. Debuting in 2023, <a
                    href=" https://www.nykaa.com/beauty-blog/nykaaland-tickets-are-live-book-your-spot-at-indias-first-ever-lifestyle-and-beauty-festival/">Nykaaland</a>
                is the first festival of its kind in its home ground. Presenting itself as India’s first ever lifestyle
                and beauty festival, the occasion was a meeting hub for the beauty world’s brightest influencers,
                industry experts such as Mario Dedivanovic, Kim Kardashian’s makeup artist, and fashion connoisseurs.
                The two-day gala was held in collaboration with <a href="https://in.bookmyshow.com/explore/events"></a>
                BookMyShow LIVE and powered by <a

                    Credit</a>, and featured numerous interactive zones, sampling and makeover stations, 12 carefully
                curated masterclasses, music performances, panel discussions and more. Many Bollywood darlings greeted
                the audience, and the event also served the stage for new launches and warm receptions to introductions
                such as actress Kriti Sanon’s own brand <a
                    href="https://letshyphen.com/collections/all?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=VM_Search_Brand_RLSA_24Aug%2723&utm_term=Kriti_Sanon&gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZr_JJDsy-yKj7GhIPC78IMtN-22PMIYJKU5jXPchMgeuVmrpuKaxTxoCcfcQAvD_BwE">Hyphen</a>.

            <p>
                A prominent participant at the event was WOW, the Bangalore-based skin care company that sought
                GoKapture to create an unforgettable booth experience for its visitors at Nykaaland. <a
                    href="https://www.buywow.in/">WOW Skin Science</a> is a home-grown brand, known particularly for its
                sprawling portfolio of products that are cruelty-free, rid of harsh chemicals and closer to nature.
            </p>
            <p>This meeting proved a fruitful venture, as the brand’s generous gift-giving was transformed through
                GoKapture’s innovation into an addictive interactive game in Mumbai that was prepared to entertain a
                crowd of hundreds. The team at <a href="https://www.gokapture.com/">GoKapture</a> understood the
                festival's ecosystem of rolling out samples and appreciative gifts, as well as the need to create a game
                booth for WOW that would make it stand apart. Thus, we came up with the <b>Interactive Game Vending
                    Machine</b> that was installed at the event as an incredibly eye-catching attraction that kept the
                WOW station alight with the curiosity and enthusiasm of the visitors.

            <p>
                To boost the brand’s visibility in a refurbished manner and garner authentic engagement, we laid out the
                groundwork for a fun tapping game that would be adored by all kinds of audiences. The key objectives of
                value interaction, longer time spent at the booth, and social media buzz were all realised by combining
                this <a
                    href="https://www.gokapture.com/benefits-of-branded-games-for-exhibitions-and-trade-shows">interactive
                    branded game</a> setup with a vending machine system that would dole out prizes, i.e., WOW’s very
                own products, to the victors. The booth was lit by the genuine smiles and gratitude of cheerful
                participants and onlookers, who were greatly vocal about the joyful moments spent at the booth, and also
                took to social media to share their experience.
